											<p><b>Dora Sarkar</b></p>

							<p>Dona Sarkar is currently working at Microsoft, and as recently as last year 
							   was working on hologram tech. She is a published author as well as a clothes designer. 
							   Dona is originally from Detroit, and she beat the odds to make it where she is 
							   now (she also failed her first CS class!). Overall, I’d make the argument she is a pretty successful women in tech.</p> 

											<p>Questions:</p> 
						<p>1)	Was the process of learning computer science a fairly straight point A to B, or was it lots of trial and error? What kinds of things</p> 
						<p>stumped you when you tried breaking into the tech industry?</p>
						<p>2)	Do you think extending your skillset to multiple industries (writing and clothing) has helped your technical skills at all? (Creativeness, diversty etc.)</p>
						<p>3)	What’s one piece of advice you would give to someone looking to work at some of the bigger tech companies (Google, Microsoft, etc.) ?</p>
									
									<p><b>Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger</b></p>


						<p>Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger is a women who is a certified Astronaut and went to space in with the STS-131 crew. 
						Dorothy was originally a teacher in High school with a bachelors in Geology. She always had a deep love for space, 
						and was accepted into the Nasa program after stumbling upon an application on the Nasa website while searching about 
						how astronauts go to bathroom in space. </p>

 											<p>Questions: </p>

						<p>1)	Do you think your parents being teachers helped influence you to go on and teach? 
						Do you think if you hadn’t been a teacher you would have ever applied to Nasa? </p>

						<p>2)	Are there any aspects of NASA that can be unfriendly towards women, specifically 
						in regards to being up in space? </p>

						<p>3)	How do you think having a mix of men and women helps forward progress in the space
						technology field? (in terms of both women astronauts and women working in NASA but not necessarily 
						going up to space, engineers, computer technicians, etc.) ? </p>
						
						
											<p><b>Kathleen Hogan</b></p>
						<p>Kathleen Hogan is the executive vice president of Microsoft’s HR department. Prior to this position 
						Kathleen was the vice president of the services team, which helped customers get the most out of their 
						investments. She also helped in the tech support department as well. Kathleen believes women should be 
						treated with equal respect in the work environment as she disapproved of women in questionable clothing 
						dancing at a Microsoft related event. Kathleen has a bachelor’s degree in applied mathematics and economics, 
						as well as an M.B.A. </p>
												<p>Questions: </p>
						<p>1)	What advice would you have for someone new to the business world that wants to aim for a high position?</p>
						<p>2)	Do you think there were any moments where you experienced adversity based on gender that helped define or strengthen you?</p>
						<p>3)	Do you feel like you still make a direct impact on tech working in HR?</p>


											<p><b>iSchool Panel (Hala and Negin)</b></p>

						<p>Hala was an international student from Jordan. She was able to come and study at University in America earning a B.S. in Business 
						Administration. She continued on to graduate school where she got her Doctorate in Information Technology. Greatly interested in Information 
						Technology, Hala enjoys herself in every minute of learning about it.</p>
						
						<p>Negin is a wonderful women who currently teaches at the U of W. She takes great interest in Digital Youth and hopes to have her work help 
						disadvantaged peoples achieve. She did her undergrad 
						at University of British Columbia and continued to get a Ph D at New York University.</p>

												<p>Questions:</p>
						<p>For Hala: Do you think that being an international student set you in an even more exclusive pool of minorities? Do you think that helped 
						shape what you ended up doing now?</p>
						<p>For Negin: Do you think that the current Generation of people are going to be able to bring about some new kind of technological advancement 
						that will usher in a new “era”?</p>
						<p>In General: What do you hope to see change in the future of the i-School here at UW, and what do you hope will always stay the same?</p>
						
												<p><b>Trisha Dziko</b></p>

						<p>Trisha Dziko is a self-made woman. Having neither parent to help her succeed in the early stages of life, she faced many hardships because of 
						her race and gender. In spite of all those obstacles, Trisha became a successful CEO of her own built up company, the Technology Access Foundation. 
						Previously Trisha experienced much success at Microsoft and became a leader in what she did.</p>

													<p>Questions:</p>
						<p>1)	In what ways do you think people can help combat un-conscience bias?</p>
						<p>2)	Do you think that making college free for everyone would be a good or bad thing? (In terms of lowering the value of a single individuals’ degree.)</p>
						<p>3)	What are your future plans for your company? Do you plan to evolve it into something else? How will you continue growing and reaching out?</p>
						
													<p><b>Alumni Panel</b></p>
						<p>Janella is a fellow Husky (like us, whooo!) and she works for Data Science Dojo, which is an organization that helps people learn the tools needed to be 
						successful with data science. They offer lessons for people that need help learning data science as a way of helping “give back to the community.”</p>
						<p>Gigi is a Cyber Security specialist at Boeing. She graduated UW and has plenty of technical experience through helping other staff in the school as well 
						as other odd jobs worked at Boeing. </p>
						<p>Colleen is a person who explores many interests. She wants to get a project management certification and work towards being an overall good manager at 
						whatever she does.</p>
													<p>Questions</p>
						<p>1)	Janella, what made you desire to help a more philanthropic company like Data Science Dojo? Could you see yourself running your own philanthropic style 
						company in the future?</p>
						<p>2)	Gigi, did you want to do Cyber Security because it’s a newly booming field and you happened to find an interest in it or did you come to UW with the 
						intent to do it from the very beginning?</p>
						<p>3)	Colleen, did pursuing varying interests help you lock down one you wanted to master, or does it feel more like a distraction at times? Do you wish you 
						had done more/less activities?</p>
