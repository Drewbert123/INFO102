							<p><b>My Expectations for the Class</b></p>
	<p>The first day of class left me with a couple questions that I had hoped to be answered from class. What is a clear cut definition for informatics? What jobs are related to the field? How does diversifying the tech field make it more effective in carrying out its job? The most important question and the one most personal to me is how informatics relates to what I want to do. From the start of class I knew I wanted to do electrical engineering, it has high potential to be hands on yet is very versatile. However, understanding how dealing with circuit integration relates to informatics would definitely be a helpful asset in seeing how my work will extend beyond just myself. 
	The main objectives for me in this course will be:
•	Understanding what Informatics is and why it’s important for the tech field
•	Why a diverse/larger pool to culminate ideas from is better
•	How I can utilize informatics in my career (formulating a career plan)</p>


<p><b>Major Take-aways</b></p>
	<p>While there were a lot of interesting and valuable things that were said in class, certain ones caught my attention more than others. It’s not that I think some things were necessarily more important than others, it was more a matter of what caught my interest and I wanted to write down for my take-away journal. Looking back through my journal, there were 4 major themes that kept reoccurring, most of which can also be connected or counted in a fifth smaller category. The themes break down as follows:
•	Ambiguity – understanding and using it
•	Advancement in Tech
•	Personal Growth and Learning
•	Mentorship</p>

<p><b>Ambiguity</b></p>
	<p>The very first day of class some of the first words I heard about informatics was that the “ambiguity” can make it difficult. Being told that you have almost complete freedom to choose how you proceeded with a project could be both a blessing and a curse. One take-away that I thought will be useful for almost anyone is that being able to explain tech to someone without a large depth of technical knowledge will be a useful skill to have, more so for anyone in the tech field. Another take-away that had me thinking about what informatics had to do with whatever job I have in the future is that the “question isn’t about technology, but what we can do with it?” This question got me thinking more about how technology will advance at a mostly steady pace, but what people choose to do with it will always be rapidly changing. This question is very ambiguous, mainly because there is not clearly defined answer, or an obvious right or wrong one. It leaves tons of opportunity to take advantage of, and the idea that I could be part of a startup that makes use of a niche is exciting. A takeaway that is similar to this one was when Laura mentioned how projects can change and adapt to answer new problems with new solutions. After hearing people like Dona and Dottie’s takes on the changing tech field the question to “what is Informatics” became a little more clear cut and less ambiguous, informatics seems like a rapidly changing field, constantly adapting to what the user wants. Due to the nature of informatics providing a service to a user it holds lots of similarity to customer services (I thought about this after I jotted down that tech support is a great entry level position). This takeaway made me think about where ambiguity takes place in the Informatics process. The problem and answer are usually clear cut, how one goes about reaching the answer is up to the team. This was made even more apparent as we saw the group projects take a more clear form. My team and another in my section answered a medical issue in two different ways, with an emergency broadcast and a thumbprint scanner that gives medical information. Overall, ambiguity is equally difficult as it is important in the Informatics field, it gives people freedom to make growth and advancements. </p>

<p><b>Advancements in Tech (and Big Data)</b></p>
	<p>Throughout the quarter Laura gave us examples of how the Information field is growing. The reading and talks in class about how the Travel Industry has been revolutionized from tech was interesting (used to need a Travel planner to now just using a website to book a flight, hotel, and tourist attraction plans). The evolution of needing a person that specializes in being knowledgeable about travel related things to the expectation of the information all being available online was interesting to see, especially as a millennial growing up with technology the idea that one would need someone to personally handle bookings for a trip seems absolutely foreign to me. Dona also mentioned its okay to try and be the dumbest person in the room, which demonstrates that with the rapid advancement of technology you won’t always be the one that knows everything. Similar take-aways that alluded to the advancement and growth of tech was the question of “Who will be the users?” Since tech is based in solving human problems, I learned that keeping in mind who the people I’m solving problems for is important to keep in mind. The iSchool panel was also interesting in terms of advancement, each person was or had done a study into some area of tech (a number of them had to do with diversity which isn’t necessarily a technological advancement, but more a social one of how people see technology and its users). </p>


<p><b>Growth and Learning</b></p>
	<p>Another major theme that kept popping up amongst the guest speakers and my take-away notes was the subject of personal growth and learning, or adaptability. One line that Dona said that stuck with me was, “Don’t focus on what you can do, focus on what you want to do” (paraphrased). It was interesting to me to see someone that many would consider to be already very successful, to have a view of herself that involves constant improvement. I thought about how I should put equal importance on mastery of one subject and continual improvement of others. Kathleen again confirmed that learning is a life-long process, she went on to get her M.B.A after joining the workforce. Kathleen enforced the idea of volunteering to help solve solutions, and that mistakes are okay. Another quote from Kathleen that I remember is the “obligation to dissention, question things!” Katie from the ischool panel is another great example of learning and adapting, she went from an elementary teacher to working with the iSchool at a prestigious University. Another take-away I found useful from the iSchool panel was to not play things safe, and to not fear failure. Failure is where the most learning happens!</p>

<p><b>Mentorship</b></p>
	<p>While this wasn’t a topic that Luara talked about as much, I noticed many of our guest speaker brought it up in some form. Each speaker had slightly different views on mentors. Dora believed that a person unlike you is best for a mentor, since they can help balance you out, and inviting the mentor into one’s element is a good way to demonstrate ones skills to them. Dottie believed that a mentor is like a role model, you should aspire to develop aspects that they have, and the importance of a mentor seeing the potential in oneself. Kathleen had a hardworking women with twins to look up to, and it’s always good to ask questions! Dona was by far the one who had the most to say about mentors. Between all the different people with different levels of success that she met, Dona had tons of people to draw inspiration from. Relationship building was another aspect that Dona touched on, the “rule of three” she mentioned (three interactions was what you needed before you were friends with someone) was interesting to see, and while I doubt our definition of friends was the same it was revealing to see how Dona viewed relationship building. Meet as many successful people as possible, and use different aspects from each to help make yourself successful. Overall, mentorship was one of the larger take-aways that I will remember outside of this class and employ in my after-graduation life.</p>

<p><b>Assessment of Objectives and Career Plan</b></p>
<p>Starting from the top, I can confidently say that this course taught me how informatics relates to what I want to do. Information Technology is very relatable to Engineering, dealing with technology and understanding the needs it has to meet are humans’ problems is key to finding a solution. With an Electrical Engineering degree I will be working with the hardware side of technology and making sure it works, hopefully dealing with integrated circuits. Since Informatics has helped teach me the constant advancement of technology and the transfer of data between people I’ll now know to keep up to date with current technology and what the leading edge in the field is. Answering a problem is something that will be present in most fields, but knowing that I also have to keep Big Data into account (transfer and utilization of information) will help me with how I choose to go about solving a problem. I can make sure that it’s at the least useable by someone with minimal training and that even though parts of it might be ambiguous to someone without a background in it I should be able to explain it proficiently enough that the basics are understandable. Having a diverse team to work with will help me by solving the “answer” to a problem. The more difficult the problem a team is solving the broader the answer will be. A diverse team will help to make sure multiple perspectives are taken into account and an answer that can accurately address larger pieces of the problem is crafted. </p>	

Moving Forward
	Informatics 102 has helped me get a better grasp of what I should do going forward in school. Before I simply thought it would be a simple A to B path, where I take the classes and (hopefully) get accepted into a program I want to be in. I now realize that things are more complicated than that. Just getting a degree is no guarantee for a job. I have to find a way to specialize in a solution to a specific problem that people need answered. The more specific the skill set the more desirable I will be. This class hasn’t really changed what degree I want to get, but now I have a desire to take classes that will help me get a firmer grasp on what the problems I need to solve are, and that being able to work well with a team of people with different backgrounds will help me to find solutions that can answer more problems better.

Special Take-Aways
o	I came to class on Cinco de Mayo!
o	Short people hate tall centerpieces. (I’m not really sure why though!)
